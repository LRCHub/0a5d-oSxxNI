Alice in the Playground
She aint got a boyfriend
Oh, Oh, That's a pity
She's not even pretty, Oh

Alice hears them whisper
They smile when they see her
Oh, Oh, She'll discover
Girls don't hurt eachother

Hey, Don't kid yourself
Girl, Love, Help yourself
Hey, Don't kid yourself
Girl, Love Help yourself
I hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, Hurt Myself
I, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt my Alice
In Vain, Vain Vain
Alice in Vain, Vain, Vain

Alice doesn't eat much
Alice don't go out much
Oh, Oh, Now you're happy
It's too late for Alice

Hey, Don't kid yourself
Girl, Love, Help yourself
Hey, Don't kid yourself
Girl, Love Help yourself
I hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, Hurt Myself
I, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt my Alice
In Vain, Vain, Vain
Alice in Vain, Vain, Vain

I hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, Hurt Myself
I hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, Hurt Myself
I hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, Hurt Myself
I hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, Hurt Myself
I, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt my Alice
In Vain, Vain, Vain
Alice in Vain, Vain, Vain
Alice in Vain, Vain, Vain
Alice in Vain, Vain, Vain
