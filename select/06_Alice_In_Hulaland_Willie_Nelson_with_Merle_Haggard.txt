Alice in Hulaland
Building castles in the sand
Living life, ain't got no plan
Just loving the boys in the band

Alice in Hulaland
Painting daisies on her van
She's number one, of their biggest fans
She loves the boys in the band

Alice in Hulaland
Come sit here on the front row
And get close to the sound
As close as you can
Are you there for the melody?
There for the lyrics?
Or just for the boys in the band?

Alice in Hulaland
Yellow bird, sitting on her hand
Singing to her, she understands
She loves the boys in the band

Alice in Hulaland
Come sit here on the front row
And get close to the sound
As close as you can
Are you there for the melody?
There for the lyrics?
Or just for the boys in the band?

Alice in Hulaland
Come sit here on the front row
And get close to the sound
As close as you can
Are you there for the melody?
There for the lyrics?
