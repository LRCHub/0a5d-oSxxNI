It's four in the afternoon
I'm on a flight leaving L.A.
Trying to figure out my life
My youth scattered along the highway

Hotel rooms and headlines
I've made a living with a song
Guitar as my companion
Wanting desperately to belong

Fame is filled with spoiled children
And we grow fat on fantasy
I guess that's why I'm leaving
I crave reality

So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road
There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
I did not find paradise
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind wanting
What's been missing in my life

I'm embarrassed to say the rest is rock and roll cliche
I hit the bottom when I reached the top
But I never knew it was you who was breaking my heart
I thought you had to love me
But you did not

Yes, a heart can hallucinate
If it's completely starved for love
It can even turn monsters into angels from above

You forged my love just like a weapon
And you turned it against me like a knife
You broke my last heartstring
You opened up my eyes

So goodbye Alice in Wonderland
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road
There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
That was not love in your eyes
It was only a reflection of my lonely mind searching
What's been missing in my life

Growing up is not the absence of dreaming
It's being able to understand the difference between
The ones you can hold and the ones that you've been sold
And dreaming is a good thing cause it brings new things to life
But pretending is an ending that perpetuates a lie
Forgetting what you are
Seeing for what you've been told

Truth is stranger than fiction
And this is my chance to get it back
And life is much better
Without all of those pretty lies, oh

So Goodbye Alice in Wonderland
And you can keep your yellow brick road
There is a difference between dreaming and pretending
These are not tears in my eyes
They are only a reflection of my lonely mind finding
They are only a reflection of my lonely mind finding
I found what's missing in my life
